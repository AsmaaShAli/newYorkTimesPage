                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                        with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                        venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special
                        energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
                        prodigiously violent instant.

                    <p>
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page 
                        and drew a double box around it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning 
                        of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
                     though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
                     It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                     of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                </p>

                    ‘As Big as It Gets’</b> </p>
            <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, 
                according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, 
                an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the 
                universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here 
                on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                    Astronomers have found evidence to support 
                    the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so
                     quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                            <span>THE UNIVERSE </span> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky
                             Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                             the universe to the other, and 
                            there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

                             You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if
                             you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

                            filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.

                            <span>INFLATION  </span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently 
                            expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

                            <span>FLUCTUATION  </span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient 
                            fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

                             like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

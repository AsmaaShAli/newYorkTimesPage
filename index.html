                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                        with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                        venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special
                        energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
                        prodigiously violent instant.

                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page 
                        and drew a double box around it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning 
                        of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
